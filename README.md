# DJ Slice!
Built with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io), a web framework for building virtual reality experiences.

## Overview

This is a work in progress.

## Development

From the dj-slice directory:

```
tsc -p ts/tsconfig.json

webpack
```

Start an HTTP server from python (you can leave this running):

```
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

Then you can browse to the page on localhost:

http://localhost:8888/dist

Happy coding!
